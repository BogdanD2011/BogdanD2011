### Hi There !
</div>
<!--
 Now is the time for me to move on with a career change and go back to my old passion, software coding. 
In the past I been used to code in  C / C++. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to code in Python, going through HyperionDev bootcamp. I'm planning to learn future coding languages as Java and I would like to have a pick
at AWS also. 

In the meantime if you are intrested in my protofolio, please feel free to have a look at my repositories.
